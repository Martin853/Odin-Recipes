    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
      Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese,
      cured pork and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its
      current name, in the middle of the 20th century.

    <h1>Recipe</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
      <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in
        boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite,
        about 12 minutes. Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and
        set aside
      </li>
      <li>
        Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir
        until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels,
        reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped
        onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced
        garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1
        minute more
      </li>
      <li>
        Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat
        and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks
        together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a
        large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan
        cheese and toss again. Season with salt and pepper (remember that bacon
        and Parmesan are very salty)
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan
        cheese at the table
      </li>
    </ol>
